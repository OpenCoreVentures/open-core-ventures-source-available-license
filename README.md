# Open Core Ventures Source Available License (OCVSAL)

## About

Open Core Ventures Source Available License (OCVSAL) is a source available license designed specifically to cover the proprietary components of software. It’s a simple license that clearly requires a commercial agreement for production use while providing access to the codebase. Here’s how it works:

- **View and modify:** Users can view, modify, test, and publish modifications to the code.
- **Commercial agreement required:** Using the software in production requires a valid commercial agreement (subscription or contract) with the license holder.
- **Modifications stay with the licensee:** The license holder retains rights to all modifications, reducing legal complexity around contributions.
